1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage 
In case an AZ is stopped and cannot operate anymore, the system must immediately and seamlessly switch to another replacement AZ. And this conversion process can take anywhere from a few minutes.
    
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
In a scenario involving an outage within a single region, the timeline unfolds as follows:

- Let's say it happened at 08:00 (0 minutes).
- After a maximum period of 5 minutes, the alarm will be activated and a notification will be sent at 08:05 (5 minutes).
- Then it takes 1 minute to notify all employees before 08:06 (1 minute)
- In order for the administrator to log into the system and diagnose the problem, the estimated time for that is 35 minutes from 08:16 to 08:41.
- After determining the cause of the problem, the process of resolving and recovering the problem is completed. This process takes about 14 minutes ending at 08:60.
- And the total expected resolution time for the above incident to occur is 60 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
In the event of an AZ outage, the transition to a backup system takes only a few minutes and may result in a small amount of data generated during that time frame being lost.     
    
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
The RPO for a region's outage depends on the frequency of data backups. If the RDS database is configured to perform automatic backups every 4 hours, the minimum RPO will be set to 4 hours. This implies that, in the worst case, if the system is inoperable for 4 hours, all data for 4 hours will be lost.
